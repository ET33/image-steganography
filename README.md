**Abstract**:  
Apply steganography techniques to embed information inside a given image. This project intends to apply DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) techniques as a method to hide information in the frequency domain of the image. The idea will be to hide binary data into a image. There might have a method to extract the data back as well.

Todo:
- [X] DCT Discrete Cosine Transform techniques to hide information in images.
- [X] Landscape images at first, trying to embed binary data inside it.
- [X] JPEG images
- [X] Information to be hidden: binary data.
